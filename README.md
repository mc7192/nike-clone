# Nike Website Clone

This project is used to demonstrate my understanding of React.js and Tailwind CSS. The tutorial can be found on JavaScript Mastery's Youtube Channel [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W3R2VwRyF4). A products page was added for additional challenge, as well as making the home button functional.
